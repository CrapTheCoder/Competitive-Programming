# Competitive-Programming
This repo contains all accepted submissions of mine in my entire CP career (from CodeChef, CodeForces, Atcoder).

The accepted solutions were scraped using Python from [codechef.com](https://www.codechef.com/), [codeforces.com](https://www.codeforces.com/), [atcoder.jp](https://atcoder.jp/) and were uploaded to this GitHub repository using the GitHub API.

Check out [UpCode](https://github.com/crapthecoder/UpCode) to see the scraper.
